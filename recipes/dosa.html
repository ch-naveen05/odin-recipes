    <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        Dosa is a popular South Indian dish made from fermented rice and urad
        dal (black gram) batter. It is a thin, crispy pancake that is typically
        served for breakfast or as a snack. Dosas are known for their light and
        airy texture, with a slightly tangy flavor due to the fermentation
        process. They can be plain or stuffed with various fillings such as
        spiced potatoes (masala dosa), paneer, or vegetables. Dosas are often
        accompanied by chutneys (coconut, tomato, mint) and sambar (a
        lentil-based vegetable stew). The preparation involves soaking rice and
        urad dal, grinding them into a smooth batter, and allowing it to ferment
        overnight. The batter is then spread thinly on a hot griddle to create
        the dosa. Dosas are not only delicious but also nutritious, making them
        a favorite choice for many.
