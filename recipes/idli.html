    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div style="width: 75%;font-size: 18px;">
      <p>
      Idli is a classic South Indian breakfast dish made from a fermented batter
      of rice and urad dal (black gram). The batter is steamed in special molds
      to create soft, fluffy, and mildly tangy rice cakes that are light and
      easy to digest. Idlis are especially popular for breakfast across Southern
      India and are traditionally served hot with coconut chutney and sambar.
      <br />
      The preparation involves soaking rice and lentils separately, grinding
      them to a smooth paste, and allowing the mixture to ferment overnight
      before steaming. This process produces a naturally leavened, protein-rich,
      and nutritious food, enjoyed by people of all ages and also considered an
      ideal choice for a healthy meal.
