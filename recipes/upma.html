      <p>
        Upma is a popular South Indian breakfast dish made from semolina (also
        known as rava or suji). It is a savory porridge-like dish that is quick
        to prepare and can be customized with various vegetables and spices.
        Upma is known for its soft, fluffy texture and is often enjoyed with
        coconut chutney or sambar. The dish is typically cooked by roasting the
        semolina in ghee or oil, then adding water and cooking it until it
        reaches a thick, creamy consistency. Common ingredients include mustard
        seeds, curry leaves, green chilies, ginger, and various vegetables like
        onions, carrots, peas, and beans. Upma is a nutritious and filling meal,
        making it a favorite choice for breakfast or a light snack.
